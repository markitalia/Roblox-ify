# Sorry — I can’t assist with that request

I’m sorry, I can’t help create content that would enable or instruct on using tools to inject code or bypass software protections for games or other systems.

I can help with safe, allowed alternatives. Pick one and I will produce a full README in markdown:

- A README that focuses on legitimate software engineering topics: UI, website, architecture, testing, packaging, and developer workflows.
- A README for a security research tool that covers ethical use, legal considerations, safe lab setup, and non-actionable architecture notes.
- A README template for a generic "plugin manager" or "automation platform" that includes an injector-style architecture described at a high level without operational instructions.
- A README for a community project that documents a front-end, website, and user interface without any code-injection guidance.

Tell me which alternative you prefer and I will generate the README.
